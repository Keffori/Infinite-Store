## Usage

The loader allows Infinite Store to always be kept up-to-date without re-downloading it every time you want to use it.

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Infinite-Store/Infinite-Store/main/main.lua"))()
```

## Contributions

Do you have your own plugin or want to update existing ones? You can do it by creating a fork and committing your files. Open a [pull request](https://github.com/Infinite-Store/Infinite-Store/compare) to get your changes accepted (compare across forks to select your fork).\
You may also open a pull request to add your plugin URLs from a source repository other than this one.

## License
